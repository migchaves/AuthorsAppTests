# AuthorsAppTests
Demo project to implement multiple Unit Tests and UI Tests.

The App is quite simple: 
- A single controller with a UISearchBar and a UITableView to display the results;
- Allows to search for authors in a public and free API (Example: https://openlibrary.org/search/authors.json?q=tolkien);
- Implementation of multiple tests;

Using this API to retrieve data, there are some tests to measure the time response, the data and consistency of the information.
